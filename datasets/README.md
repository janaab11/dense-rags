# Datasets

Each dataset is contained in its own directory. A few files to expect in there:

- Data files
  - `data.csv` : dataset with Documents
  - `eval.csv` : dataset with evaluation Queries/Answers
- `download.py` : script to create one or more Data files
- `vector_db/` : directory that holds the Vector Store
